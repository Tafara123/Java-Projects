👋 Hi everyone!
I’m Tafara Warren Machiridza, and I’m excited to be part of the Mainframe Migration team
at BMW!
🌍 A Bit About Me
I was born in Zimbabwe but grew up in South Africa, where I spent most of my life. In
October 2021, I moved to Germany to further my studies, and I’m currently in my final
semester pursuing a B.Sc. in Applied Artificial Intelligence at TH Rosenheim. My
academic journey has given me a strong foundation in AI, machine learning, and
data-driven solutions.
💼 My Professional Journey
Before joining BMW, I worked at Allianz as a Working Student in AI, where I contributed to
several exciting projects, including:
✅ AI Model Monitoring & Automation – Developed a scalable system for tracking the
performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) through real-time keyword analysis and
external API integrations.
✅ Conversational AI & Chatbots – Designed and implemented a prototype AI chatbot,
optimizing agent workflows and integrating reusable components for improved user
interaction.
✅ Data Optimization & Quality Assurance – Enhanced data validation and system
configurations, ensuring high accuracy and consistency across AI-driven solutions.
✅ AI-Driven Insights – Helped refine AI models and analytics to better align with business
goals and enhance customer experiences.
This experience sharpened my skills in AI development, automation, and data
engineering, all of which I’m eager to leverage in the Mainframe Migration team.
🔧 Skills I Bring to the Team
I have hands-on experience in:
🚀 Machine Learning & AI (LLMs, NLP, RAG, AI Chatbots)
💾 Data Engineering & Automation (Python, SQL, Data Pipelines)
☁ Cloud & Infrastructure (AWS, Azure, Linux, MLOps)
💻 Software Development (Java, JavaScript, APIs, System Optimization)
⚽ Hobbies & Interests
Outside of work, I’m a big fan of football (both playing & watching), I love jogging, and I’m
obsessed with billiards—I could play for hours!
🚀 Looking Ahead
Joining BMW is an incredible opportunity, and I’m thrilled to be part of a team that’s driving
innovation. I’m looking forward to learning, growing, and contributing to the success of
Mainframe Migration. Let’s collaborate, tackle challenges, and make an impact together.
Feel free to connect with me—whether it’s about AI, data, or even a friendly game of
billiards! Looking forward to working with all of you
